# UI/UX Principles for Mobile

## Fundamental UX Laws

### Fitts's Law
The time to reach a target depends on distance and size.
- **Mobile implication**: Make important actions large and close to thumb
- Place primary buttons in comfortable reach zones
- Increase touch target size for critical/frequent actions

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with number and complexity of choices.
- **Mobile implication**: Fewer options = faster decisions
- Limit choices per screen
- Use progressive disclosure—reveal complexity gradually
- Group related actions

### Miller's Law
Average person can hold ~7 items in working memory.
- **Mobile implication**: Don't overwhelm with information
- Chunk content into digestible groups
- Use visual hierarchy to prioritize
- Show only what's needed now

### Jakob's Law
Users spend most time on *other* apps—they expect yours to work similarly.
- **Mobile implication**: Follow platform conventions
- Don't reinvent standard patterns
- Innovation in content, not navigation

### Law of Proximity
Elements close together are perceived as related.
- **Mobile implication**: Group related items visually
- Use spacing to create relationships
- Separate unrelated actions

### Law of Common Region
Elements sharing a boundary are perceived as grouped.
- **Mobile implication**: Use cards, containers, backgrounds
- Visual containers create meaning
- Borders and backgrounds guide understanding

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Users perceive beautiful designs as more usable.
- **Mobile implication**: Invest in visual polish
- Beautiful apps feel easier to use
- First impressions matter enormously

## Mobile-Specific Principles

### The Thumb Zone
Users hold phones differently—design for all grips.
- Bottom of screen = easiest to reach
- Top corners = hardest to reach (especially one-handed)
- Primary actions belong in the comfort zone

### Focused Attention
Mobile users are often distracted, multitasking, or in motion.
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Scannable content
- Obvious call-to-actions
- Forgiving of mistakes

### Micromoments
Mobile interactions are often brief and goal-oriented.
- Support quick tasks
- Remember user state
- Enable one-handed use when possible
- Minimize steps to complete actions

### Context Sensitivity
Mobile usage varies wildly—indoors/outdoors, sitting/walking, focused/distracted.
- Design for varying light conditions
- Consider network variability
- Support interruption and resumption
- Work offline when possible

## Interaction Principles

### Direct Manipulation
Users should feel they're touching the content itself.
- Objects respond to touch directly
- Dragging moves things naturally
- Gestures feel physical

### Feedback & Response
Every action needs acknowledgment.
- Visual feedback immediately (< 100ms)
- Loading states for longer operations
- Success/error confirmation
- Haptic feedback for important actions

### Forgiveness
Make errors reversible and recoverable.
- Undo for destructive actions
- Confirmation for irreversible actions
- Easy to go back
- Clear how to fix mistakes

### Consistency
Same actions should work the same way everywhere.
- Visual consistency (colors, spacing, typography)
- Behavioral consistency (gestures, interactions)
- Platform consistency (follow OS patterns)

### Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed, when it's needed.
- Don't front-load complexity
- Reveal advanced features gradually
- Use context to determine what's relevant
- Collapse secondary information

## Visual Design Principles

### Hierarchy
Guide the eye through content intentionally.
- Size, weight, and color create importance
- Spacing creates groupings
- Position implies priority (top/center = important)

### Contrast
Make important things stand out.
- High contrast for primary actions
- Lower contrast for secondary elements
- Ensure readability in all conditions

### Alignment
Create order and connection through alignment.
- Consistent margins and gutters
- Grid-based layouts
- Text alignment creates flow

### White Space
Empty space is not wasted—it's functional.
- Breathing room improves comprehension
- Spacing separates sections
- Generous padding improves touch accuracy

### Typography
Text is the primary interface element.
- Readable at arm's length
- Clear hierarchy through size/weight
- Appropriate line length
- Support system text scaling

## Emotional Design

### Delight
Surprise users with thoughtful details.
- Micro-animations that reward
- Personality in copy and illustration
- Celebration of achievements
- Polish in unexpected places

### Trust
Build confidence through design.
- Professional, polished appearance
- Clear about data and privacy
- Honest about errors and limitations
- Consistent and predictable behavior

### Empathy
Understand user's emotional state.
- Error messages that help, not blame
- Appropriate tone for context
- Respect user's time and attention
- Accommodate different abilities

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Dark Patterns
Never trick users.
- No hidden costs or options
- Easy unsubscribe/delete
- Clear what actions do
- Respect user's choices

### Cognitive Overload
Don't overwhelm.
- Too many options
- Too much information
- Too many steps
- Too many notifications

### Inconsistency
Don't confuse.
- Mixed metaphors
- Inconsistent terminology
- Unpredictable behavior
- Breaking platform conventions

### Ignoring Accessibility
Don't exclude.
- Color as only indicator
- Small touch targets
- No text alternatives
- Ignoring system preferences
