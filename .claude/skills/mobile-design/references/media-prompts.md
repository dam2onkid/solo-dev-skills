## Prompt Best Practices

### For Consistent Results

1. Specify exact platform (iOS 17, Material Design 3)
2. Include device model for proper dimensions
3. Use hex color codes for accuracy
4. Reference specific font names
5. Describe spacing in pt/dp units
6. Include aspect ratio for mockups (--ar 9:19 for phones)

### For Quality Output

1. Request "high fidelity" or "production quality"
2. Specify resolution when needed
3. Include "clean", "professional", "modern"
4. Describe the mood/emotion you want
5. Mention what should NOT be included

### For Iteration

1. Start with basic composition
2. Add detail in subsequent prompts
3. Reference previous outputs
4. Adjust specific elements while keeping base
5. Use negative prompts to remove unwanted elements
