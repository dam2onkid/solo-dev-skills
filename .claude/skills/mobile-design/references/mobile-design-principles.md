# Mobile Design Principles

## Platform Philosophy

### iOS-First Approach

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines represent the highest standard for mobile design. Even when building cross-platform, iOS quality is the benchmark.

**Why iOS as standard**:
- Most rigorous design guidelines
- Highest user expectations
- Best-in-class native apps as references
- Design language that translates well

### Apple's Three Pillars

**Clarity**: Content is paramount
- Text legible at every size
- Icons precise and meaningful
- Minimal decorative elements
- Function drives form

**Deference**: UI serves content
- Full-screen experiences
- Translucency hints at depth
- Chrome disappears when not needed
- Content is the interface

**Depth**: Layering creates meaning
- Visual hierarchy through elevation
- Transitions explain relationships
- Touch reveals layers
- Motion creates understanding

## Visual Design

### Typography

**System fonts have intention**:
- SF Pro: Engineered for legibility, not "default"
- SF Pro Rounded: Softer, friendlier contexts
- New York: Editorial, long-form reading

**Hierarchy through confidence**:
- Bold size jumps between levels
- Weight variations create emphasis
- Tracking adjusts with size
- Line height ensures readability

### Color

**Restraint over abundance**:
- Monochrome foundation
- Single accent carries meaning
- Color communicates, not decorates
- Both light/dark modes considered from start

**Beyond default blue**:
- Health apps: warm reds/pinks
- Productivity: cool neutrals
- Entertainment: vibrant, dynamic
- Finance: trust-building tones

### Space & Composition

**Generous negative space**:
- Content breathes
- Margins protect from edges
- Sections clearly separated
- Focus through emptiness

**Intentional density**:
- Dense when scanning (lists)
- Spacious when focusing (detail)
- Rhythm through consistent spacing

## Touch Design

### Thumb-Centric

Design for one-handed use:
- Primary actions in easy reach
- Critical buttons in bottom third
- Navigation in natural thumb arc
- Destructive actions harder to reach

### Touch Quality

**Immediate response**:
- Visual feedback within frame
- No perceived delay
- State changes obvious

**Comfortable targets**:
- Easy to tap without precision
- Spacing prevents errors
- Important targets larger

## Accessibility

### Built-In, Not Bolt-On

- Dynamic Type from the start
- VoiceOver considered in design
- Color never sole indicator
- Motion has alternatives

### Apple's Accessibility Excellence

Study how Apple apps handle:
- Text scaling at extremes
- Screen reader navigation
- Reduced motion preferences
- High contrast modes

## Quality Bar

**Would this feel at home next to Apple's apps?**

- Is every element intentional?
- Does it feel premium?
- Is the animation natural?
- Does the typography have hierarchy?
- Is there visual rest?
